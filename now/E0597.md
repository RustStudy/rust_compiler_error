This error occurs because a borrow was made inside a variable which has a greater lifetime than the borrowed one.

Example of erroneous code:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: Option<&'a u32>,
}

let mut x = Foo { x: None };
let y = 0;
x.x = Some(&y); // error: `y` does not live long enough
```

In here, x is created before y and therefore has a greater lifetime. Always keep in mind that values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are created. So to fix the previous example, just make the y lifetime greater than the x's one:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: Option<&'a u32>,
}

let y = 0;
let mut x = Foo { x: None };
x.x = Some(&y);
```

发生此错误是因为在变量中使用了借用，该变量生命周期长于借用。

错误代码示例：


```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: Option<&'a u32>,
}

let mut x = Foo { x: None };
let y = 0;
x.x = Some(&y); // error: `y`活得不够长
```

这里x先于y被创建，因此它有更长的生命周期。请记住，作用域中的值析构顺序与其创建顺序相反。因此要修复前面的错误，只需要使y的生命周期长于x的：

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: Option<&'a u32>,
}

let y = 0;
let mut x = Foo { x: None };
x.x = Some(&y);
```
